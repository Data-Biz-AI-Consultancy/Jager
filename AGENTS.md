# Agent Rules & Conventions

## dbt Naming Conventions

### Staging Models
- For all staging models in the dbt project (located under `dbt/models/staging/`), the SQL file name must always be prefixed with the target schema name followed by a double underscore (e.g., `staging__<source_name>__<table_name>.sql`).
- References to these models in downstream models (intermediate, marts) must use this fully prefixed name.
